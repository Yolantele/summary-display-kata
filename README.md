https://venue-lister.herokuapp.com/venues is an end-point that returns information about 50 venues.

The format of each venue in the response is as follows:

{
	"id": "edd15587-633a-4bd1-b588-e72254a4f020",
	"name": "Ballsbridge Hotel",
	"address1": "Pembroke Rd",
	"postcode": "D4",
	"city": "Dublin",
	"listing_text": "When it comes to first-class conference facilities Ballsbridge..."
}


Kata to-do list: 
- make it a small single-page React application that displays a summary/card of the venues
- choose how to style the layout freely
- have 10 venues per page displayed, and a way to navigate between the 5 pages of venues. 
- responsi UI - for example, so if the layout width is small, the page should update accordingly.

- sum up the approach to solving the problem and explain the thinking
